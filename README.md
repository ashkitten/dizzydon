# Troubleshooting and FAQ
* # What's Pico-8stodon?
* * This is the older version of Dizzydon. It's recommended that you use Dizzydon instead, as this is no longer actively maintained and lacks all of Dizzydon's customization without any benefits of it's own. It's available on userstyles.org so you can download it easily from there if you like the default colors and transparency effects.
[Install with Stylus from userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/163455/pico-8stodon) 
* # Hey, this doesn't change anything on my instance?
* * Be sure to add your mastodon instance to the "Applies to" section on the styles settings page to use it on an instance that's not alread set up. Open the management page for Stylus, then click this style in the list, then add your instances domain to the list of websites it applies to at the bottom or middle of the edit page.

* # The shadows are flickering
* * Drop shadows use hardware-acceleration, so this is probably related to your graphics hardware.
* * If using Dizzydon, turn off the drop-shadows in the settings menu.
* * If using pico-8stodon, install the no-filter version. Open the management page for stylus -> click the "Write new style" button -> click the import button under Mozilla Format -> copy and paste the code from pico-8stodon_no-filter.css -> name it and save. Then just use that version as you would the other.
