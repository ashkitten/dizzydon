# Themes
Themes are stripped down versions of dizzydon that only alter the colors and nothing else. They are meant to be used in addition to Dizzydon to allow custom color settings to be saved and shared.

Dizzydon themes are installed and used just like the base Dizzydon.
Open the raw <theme>.user.css file in your browser and install it with stylus. Then enable it on any site you use Dizzydon on so it overrides the colors.
